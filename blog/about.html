      <h2>I serve society, it does not serve me.</h2>

      My good friend Tony Zhu fancies himself a flanuer. What is that, you ask?

      Flanuer: a person of leisure, deliberately aimless, simply wandering the streets and soaking in the city.

      I had been a flanuer for a while now, watching others pass me by chasing meaning. I hoped to bump into some passion or
      cause around the corner like someone might bump into their future spouse in a TV show. I've baked myself into a
      cake for society to consume because it's easy and mildly furfilling to do so, but in doing so I served society, 
      it did not serve me.

      Well, I can't sell my cake and eat it too. So, this year I want to create, not consume. Create friendships, create
      art, create meaning. I want to be intentional about what I do so I can experience and enjoy the pieces I slice out
      of my cake from my own hard work. I set myself 9 goals to guide me towards where I want to be this year, and I've shared 8
      here to hold myself accountable (one is rather personal).

      <ul>
        <li>
          I want to meet at least two new and interesting people every week, and reconnect with one person every two weeks. 
          I've been prioritizing other things over people, when people are the most meaningful existences on the planet. 
          Time and time again the people I know have pointed me towards opportunities and interests I now can't do without.
          I also want to become more comfortable connecting with others.
        </li>

        <li>
          I want to publish 26 structured things of content. Think informative articles, critical reviews, analysis of media, 
          journalism, vlogs, and maybe even Twitch stream highlight reels. Though my work at university has stretched my
          quantitative reasoning skills, I haven't spent as much time thinking critically about politics, philosophy, or other
          topics I used to ponder about daily. By building opinions I can focus and strengthen my critical thinking skills.
        </li>

        <li>
          I want to create 26 different pieces of writing, art, music, and other creative work. I want to channel my creative
          energies when they arise instead of stifling them. This might be piano or melodica covers of music, comedic poems or
          me finally sitting down and learning how to draw, again. There is so much raw imaginative experience that I want to share
          to others which are bottled inside because I lack the artistic skill, skill that I can slowly develop.
        </li>

        <li>
          I want to build 10 interesting and significant projects using a bunch of different technologies. Major open source projects,
          like Kitsu's website or Osu Lazer count, but only after 5 merged PRs. Since entering my second year I haven't spent as much
          time building projects, and most of my day to day dev work consists of the same tech stacks, so I'm not learning as much
          as I used to.
        </li>

        <li>
          I want to go to 5 hackathons.
        </li>

        <li>
          I want to have proof-of-concepts or sharable results in a more academic, research heavy project.
        </li>

        <li>
          I want to read 26 books and write about them on this blog.
        </li>

        <li>
          I want to bootstrap a cash-flow positive business. I am by no means an experience Entreprenuer, but I definetly want to become one.
          There's no substitute for learning by doing, especially when it comes to startups though. I want to create a sustainable business,
          make all the mistakes in the process, and learn as much as I can from it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      - I want to become a kinder person.

      - I want to care less about results, and more about meaning.

      - I want to find a cause I care about.

      - I want to live more.

      - I want to be curious.

      I want to have more confidence, gratitude, and open-mindedness, less complacency, and check in with myself often.
